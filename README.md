# 🌍 Build a School in Kenya — Charity Website

Welcome to the official repo for the charity stream website project supporting the construction of a primary school in Kenya!

This is a fun and meaningful way to get involved — not only do you get to practice your web dev/design skills, but your contribution will help raise visibility and funds for a real educational project. 💚

## 💡 What's this about?

We're building a landing page to promote a charity initiative by *Gruppo Nairobi*, a non-profit building a 6-classroom school for kids in the Machakos District, Kenya. The website will help us collect donations, tell the story, and show progress.

But this repo is not just about the cause — it's also about creativity and collaboration. If you love designing or coding, **this is your playground**.

## 🎨 Figma Design (Optional Starting Point)

We've put together a draft design on Figma to give you a starting idea of what the site could look like.  
👉 [View the Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/whRPIFr9S16t6tA8tpDqV3/nairobi-group-page?node-id=0-1&t=JXDeLwcFAKvELLad-1)

Feel free to use it, remix it, or go completely rogue with your own vision — **we're open to fresh takes**!
