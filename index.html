      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Gruppo Nairobi is a dedicated non-profit organization with a bold vision – to build an elementary school comprising six classrooms to offer quality education to children facing severe economic challenges. Our mission stems from the firm belief that education is the cornerstone of development and that every child deserves the chance to build a brighter future.</p>

    <section id="where">
      <h2>Where</h2>
      <p>The school will be built in Kenya, approximately 90 km from Nairobi, in the Municipality of Ngunga Paris within the Machakos District. Situated near the Tanzanian border, this region suffers from high poverty rates and limited access to quality educational facilities.</p>

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>The inspiration for this project came from Sister Hitha, a cherished mentor and former school director with whom we have a long history – including our collaborative efforts in establishing a school in Kerala, India. Now in Kenya, Sister Hitha leads a dedicated team of Indian and Kenyan nuns committed to providing educational opportunities for children who, due to financial hardships, cannot attend public schools. Our initiative not only seeks to lift these children out of poverty through education but also aims to create local opportunities that help reduce illegal immigration.</p>
